Its 200-hp i-VTEC&amp;#174; engine accelerates smoothly in any gear and engine speed through either a close-ratio 6-speed manual or a 5-speed Sequential SportShift with Grade Logic Control automatic transmission. Its outstanding handling and agility is due partly to the engine's lightweight materials.

    <rdfs:comment>Mitsubishi will be releasing its first pickup, developed in collaboration with DaimlerChrysler, for the 2006 model year. Based on the Dodge Dakota platform, the Raider represents part of the company's attempt to reestablish its brand identity in the U.S. after a year of slumping sales. The name &quot;Raider&quot; was originally used on a Dodge SUV that shared its construction with the Mitsubishi Montero. The base models will most likely be powered by the Dakota's 3.7-liter V6, which is capable of 210 horsepower. High-end versions of the Raider are expected to house a 4.7-liter V8, which yields 230 hp and 290 pound-feet of torque. This particular engine will be mated with a five-speed automatic which allows for paddle shifting via the steering wheel. The Raider will be available in both extended-cab and four-door versions, with the choice of two- or four-wheel drive.</rdfs:comment>

There are two main models, the 4-door sedan and 5-door wagon. The sedan is further divided into an entry level called I and sportier versions coming under the S name.

SuperCabs have two rear fold-down jump seats as standard or optional, depending on trim, and are available with back-hinged rear access doors. Regulars offer 6- and 7-ft cargo beds; SuperCabs use the 6 ft only. Engines comprise a 2.3-liter 4-cyl and 3.0- and 4.0-liter V6s. All use manual or 5-speed automatic transmission and standard rear-wheel drive. V6s also offer 4WD that can't be used on dry pavement but includes low-range gearing. All models come with 4-wheel ABS. Leather upholstery is among the many options. Mazda's B-Series trucks are retrimmed Rangers with a different pricing and features mix.

    <rdfs:comment>With the CTS-V already burning up the streets with its Corvette-sourced V8, Cadillac has turned its attention to the XLR for V-Series treatment. Instead of an LS6 V8, however, the XLR-V is expected to get a supercharged version of its standard 4.6-liter Northstar V8. A full complement of performance enhancements such as larger wheels and tires, recalibrated suspension and stronger brakes should round out the package giving Cadillac a serious performance entry in the luxury convertible segment.</rdfs:comment>

When shopping for the Honda Accord, you must test drive a comparable BMW or Mercedes C320 because the ride of these exotic cars is much less comfortable. You will feel better knowing that you saved money getting a real car instead. For those looking for a car with more room, you should also consider the 2009 Honda Accord EX-L which is essentially the top of the line Accord today.</rdfs:comment>

For 04, Pontiac has replaced the excess plastic cladding on the Grand Prix with the clean looks of the G-Force show car (News, May 2002) and given it a BMW-like twin-port grille. An evolution of the 97-03 Grand Prix, the new GP marches toward modernity--hot on the heels of the Vibe and the Z4-like Solstice concept--but on an updated version of that 97-03 platform. Changes include wider-opening rear doors (82 versus 67 degrees), a 10-inch-wider-opening trunk, and nearly six-inch-lower lift-in height--better for hauling mountain bikes and such that otherwise might steer buyers to an SUV.</rdfs:comment>

Both two- and four-door versions are offered in three trim levels.

    <rdfs:comment>The sedan is the larger 4-door model of Honda's ultra-popular Civic line of cars. Internally, the sedan is no different than the coupe model, featuring the same engine and features, the difference is all on the outside, with more storage capacity for people in the back seat as well as a larger trunk. The 2007 model stays in the eighth generation of Civics which follows the bold and futuristic styling that has garnered mixed reactions.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>Building on BMW's thoroughbred sports coupe heritage, the 6's aggressive lines and low-slung kidney-grille project a dynamic spirit and a compelling sense of style. Behind the wheel, it's pure passion. A heart-pounding launch to 60 mph in a mere 5.3 seconds*, fired by a 4.8-liter V-8 engine and controlled by your choice of three precise 6-Speed transmissions. Exceptional performance and level handling in the fastest corners with BMW's innovative new Active Roll Stabilization (ARS). Refined luxury and a near-obsessive attention to the smallest of details. The 6 Coupe. Exceed expectations.</rdfs:comment>

The Fit is Honda's answer to the surge in the minicar category with the Toyota Yaris and Nissan's Versa. In creating the Fit Honda preempted the concerns about small cars and offers a host of standard safety features including side front airbags, side curtain airbags, and an anti-lock braking system.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>The Matrix is Toyota's answer to the working professional that likes to seek adventure on the weekends. When it was introduced in 2003, the Matrix was one of the first vehicles known as Crossovers that combine the storage requirements of a van or SUV, with the handling and speed of a sedan. For 2007 the Matrix remains largely unchanged from its first model featuring minor improvements across the board. The 2006 Matrix had a sporty XRS model, and All Wheel Drive options available, but both of those are dropped for 2007. Trimming down the model lineup leaves the base model, and a slightly upgraded XR model. Built upon the Corolla base the Matrix is jointly developed with General Motors who offers an almost identical vehicle in the Pontiac Vibe.</rdfs:comment>

The 2007 Jetta is part of the fifth generation of models introduced in the 2006 year. Previous Jettas were available in wagon versions, but for 2007 VW is offering only a sedan. There are four different models which vary in features and engine that range from an entry level price of $16,000 to the fully loaded GLI which comes in at $31,000. This broad range of prices makes it competitive to the other compact cars such as the Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra, while on the upper end making it compete with Nissan's Altima. With the new generation Volkswagen focused on strength and rigidity using high strength steel and laser welding in the manufacturing process.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>The 2009 Nissan Altima Coupe is a marginal update to the previous year's newly introduced 2008 Altima Coupe. While the models between the two years are almost identical save for some minor improvements on the 2009 - including a higher-finish grille and larger wheel sizes on the more expensive trim levels - the differences with the Altima Sedan are quite significant. Most obvious is the exterior styling of the two cars as the Coupe has both a shorter wheel-base and shorter height to achieve a sportier look while sacrificing interior room, particularly in the trunk area. Interior-wise both cars feature a very similar setup using the same engine and offering almost identical packages. The Altima Coupe stands out somewhat from the crowd, and even from the Sedan model, as the base packages include a relatively large amount of premium features including heated seats, 6-speaker audio system, side airbags, moonroof, power-everything, etc. There are 2 main trim levels with an optional premium package per trim.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>You didn't get to where you're at by waiting around. So the immediate acceleration of the 3.3-liter VVT-i V6 of Camry SE is utterly practical. But if luxury is more your speed, take a look at the XLE V6 with standard moonroof and leather-trimmed interior, or the Camry LE with power driver's seat and steering wheel audio controls. (Even the Camry Standard has air conditioning, CD player and cruise control all included.) And Camry gets you farther on less with a surprising rating of 24 estimated city, 34 highway miles per gallon. Hey, Camry knows how you like to travel through life.

The wire mesh grille, gaudy exterior and numerous high-performance touches are intended to snare younger buyers into the brand. This midsize will be powered by a 3.8-liter MIVEC high-output V6, which yields 260 horsepower. This engine will be mated to a five-speed automatic transmission.

Due to the extra space requirements that the battery cells require to power the electric motor, the sedan model is the only available hybrid form. Furthermore, the battery cells reduce the available trunk space from 12 cubic feet in the non-hybrid Civic Sedan to 10.4 on the Hybrid. The battery cells also prevent the rear seats from folding inwards, to give more storage space, like they do on the non-hybrid version.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment>Simply put, the Ford GT is an all-American supercar that was created in homage to the GT40 racecars that dominated competition at Le Mans in the mid-1960s. A supercharged, midmounted V-8 produces 550 horsepower, which is roughly equivalent to the output from the original, larger engine that went into competition GT40 cars. A limited-edition model for 2006 commemorates Ford's 1966 victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.</rdfs:comment>

This Audi allroad quattro concept falls firmly into the latter category.

    <rdfs:comment>Ferrari will replace the 575 Maranello with a variant of the 612 Scaglietti, which could retain the Maranello name or go by the new moniker of &quot;Imola.&quot; Either way, the Ferrari 600 will be an exceptionally powerful car, with a 6.0-liter version of the Scaglietti's V12. This lethal engine is expected to yield as much as 580 to 600 horsepower. This engine will be paired with a clutchless manual transmission. In addition to engine strength, the 600 will also improve its interior room and luggage space over the current Maranello. Designed by Pininfarina, the Ferrari 600 will be built on a shorter version of the Scaglietti's aluminum spaceframe chassis and also use the 612's front/midengine layout. The 600 should weigh in close to the Scaglietti at roughly 4,000 pounds. When it debuts in the spring of 2006, the Ferrari 600 will feature an MSRP somewhere in between the F430 and the Scaglietti</rdfs:comment>
