	 Several methods for implementing data-
	
	base queries expressed as logical rules are
	
	given and they are compared for efficiency.
	
	One method, called “magic sets,” is a
	
	general algorithm for rewriting logical rules
	
	so that they may be implemented bottom-
	
	UP (= forward chaining) in a way that
	
	cuts down on the irrelevant facts that are
	
	generated. The advantage of this scheme
	
	is that by working bottom-up, we can take
	
	advantage of efficient methods for doing
	
	massive joins. Two other methods are ad
	
	hoc ways of implementing “linear” rules,
	
	i.e., rules where at most one predicate in
	
	any body is recursive. These methods are},
