Before the start
Before u2r3 can be used the H2 database has to be started. If you use the DB from the repository than it's also possible to use the accompanying script h2.sh to start the database.

How to run
Normally u2r3 cannot run on its on because it is just small part of another library the OWLAPI.
But the standard distribution of u2r3 contains some test tools for ontologies.
These contain a tool too load an ontology and a tool to check a test case

Load an ontology
java de.langenmaier.u2r3.tests.LoadOntology <absolute file>

Load a test case
java de.langenmaier.u2r3.tests.rules.TestCase <folder> [<testcase> [<number>]]
