README

This is the readme for the University Ulm Relation Reasoner for OWL2 RL.

Necessary libs
 * H2 Database v1.1.116 or higher
 * OWLAPI v3 (r1323 or higher)
both are contained in the standard repository.


How to get the current repository

$ svn co https://81.89.103.197/svn/repos/u2r3/trunk
use
$ svn up trunk/
on a checked out project to update it.

How to build 
with Eclipse
Open the project file an eclipse takes care of the rest.

with ant
$ ant #in the root directory of the project
The default target creates the folders build, dist, javadoc.
In dist will be a jar file of the current project. In the javadoc folder will be the generated Java documentation of the code.


Before the start
Before u2r3 can be used the H2 database has to be started. If you use the DB from the repository than it's also possible to use the accompanying script h2.sh to start the database.

How to run
Normally u2r3 cannot run on its on because it is just small part of another library the OWLAPI.
But the standard distribution of u2r3 contains some test tools for ontologies.
These contain a tool too load an ontology and a tool to check a test case

Load an ontology
./loadreasoner.sh <absolute filepath>
e.g.
./loadreasoner.sh file:///home/sl17/workspace/u2r2/ontologien/sample.owl

Load a test case
./runtestcase <folder> [<testcase> [<number>]]
e.g.
 ./runtestcase.sh /home/sl17/workspace/u2r2/ontologien/tests/owl2rl/ cls-avf
 
Changing the settings for the operational mode for u2r3
The settings for running the the reasoner can be changed in the configuration file: u2r3.properties
The settings can be overridden in the runtime-settings of a particular application.
